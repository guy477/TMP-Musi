# TMP-Musi
Group playlist making for car rides. (Assumptions: the users will be respectable humans and choose logical music)

## The Details
one person becomes operator of said playlist with their phone, and everyone else is able to send requests
through the website to queue songs. For the mean time all songs will be put into a playlist to be able to play.

## Options
* songs queue up in a playlist that can be saved later
* songs get deleted as the playlist continues?

## ToDo
* Get connected to Spotify api
* Get connected to Apple Music api
* Set up backend (commands that will make the app go round)

## Done
* Set up background credential and gitignore
